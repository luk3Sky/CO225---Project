### Fractals: Natures building blocks
Implementing a software that would plot two of the most popular fractals: "Mandelbrot set" and "Julia set". Fractals are infinity precise, self-similar shapes formed
by some simple mathematical computations. The computation varies from fractal set to set but are
generally based on complex numbers.

The software is written on java purely

### Includes:
- AWT - Java abstract window toolkit
- Math library for complex numbers

### Usage:
```bash
$ Java Fractal <Mandelbrot>
$ Java Fractal <Mandelbrot> <real range> <complex range> <scale factor>
$ Java Fractal <Julia>
$ Java Fractal <Julia> <real part of c> <complex part of c> <scale factor>
```
